# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise is launching a campaign on Kickstarter for her play "Fever", and has come close to her fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Because of this, she wanted to know how other campaigns performed based on their launch date and their fundraising goals. What is being done here is taking a bunch of data from Kickstarter and comparing the results of their outcome against the launch date for those campaigns. The main focus will be in the theater category on Kickstarter!

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When the outcome of a project is compared to its launch date, we can get a good idea of when might be a good time to launch a campaign. When looking at this line graph, we can see a somewhat steady increase and decrease in successful projects, and it appears sometime between May and June are great times to launch a theater campaign!

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When looking at this data, it looks very interesting! We can see here that a lot of successful projects are around the $0-$5000 range, and it begins to drop when you get about $15000. There are some successful campaigns in the $35000-$44999 range, but it seems ill-advised to stake your goal that high if you want a successful campaign, as the risks can outweigh the benefits. There is always a chance, but a safe bet would to be launching a campaign at least at or less than $4000.

## Results

There appear to be good launch dates between May and June, and it begins to fail near the end of the year. The best time to launch theater campaigns seem to be around the middle of the year, this should give you the best chances of success according to data.

The best goal for a successful campaign seems to be around less than $5000. Louise can take a risk and aim for around $40000, but it is definitely assuming she has a way to captivate the target audience.

One of the things that could have been present in the dataset are the amounts a given campaign increased or decreased during its launch.
